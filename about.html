  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Founded by Isabella, Aureme Jewelry is the embodiment of feminine empowerment and elegance. 
    Born in a traditional Chinese family that valued sons over daughters, Isabella grew up 
    experiencing gender inequality firsthand. As she matured, she embraced feminism and dreamed 
    of creating a space where women could reveal their own beauty and confidence. 
    <br><br>
    Aureme Jewelry uses eco-friendly, recyclable materials, focusing on alloys, 925 silver, cubic zirconia, and moissanite to craft each piece with care and intention.
